barman (default): Hello! It's me, Bar Maker, the perfect mix of a bartender and a matchmaker. I'm the one jiggling behind the bar.\
My goal, and yours by extension, is to pair people around a table so they have fun!
barman (default): Easy game.\
- Right click on someone to learn more about them.\
- Left click on someone to pick him up and place him at a table.\
When you're done making pairs, click on the finish button. (On the top left corner mate!)
barman: You'll quickly see that it can be a frustrating job... Or a rewarding one! Let's try with these two at the bar. They love the same thing and both hate some kind of alcohol, looks like an easy match to me!
